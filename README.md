Mod 3 Project for FIS DC DS 08292019


## Collaborators:
- *Anastasia Kharina*

## Goals:
Generate insights about precious metal ETFs to guide investment decisions.

### Stakeholder:
*Ned, our Newbie Investor Neighbor*  
Ned has asked for our help in making a difficult decision: which precious metal to invest in for his portfolio. We decided to look into two precious metal *gold* and *silver* in form of bullion Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and mining index ETFs to help him answer this question.
We also used Dow Jones Industrial Average as the market index.
